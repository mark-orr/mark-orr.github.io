                        ... I'm workin on merging computational models of cognitive and behavioral processes with social systems (e.g., networks), building novel empirical paradigms for testing new theoretical aspects of (for now human) social systems, and thinking about how novel data streams might be used to infer causal mechanisms in cognito-behavioral social systems. The topics below capture some new pushes on these fronts.  Feedback is welcome.  <br>

                        ... We are in the process of conducting a review of the computational models of attitudes from the social psychology literature.  The objective is to 1) assess the gaps w.r.t. what we know about human information processing, 2) to propose a theoretical perspective that closes the gaps and aligns with contemporary cogntive science and neuroscience perspectives.
